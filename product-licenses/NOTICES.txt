      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Eclipse Public License - v 1.0

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC
LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation
   distributed under this Agreement, and
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
    i) changes to the Program, and
   ii) additions to the Program;

   where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
   distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates'
   from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor
   itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not
   include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of
   software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own
   license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this
Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
     Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
     reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly
     perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor,
     if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.
  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
     Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
     Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise
     transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and
     object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of
     the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is
     added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such
     combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license
     shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution.
     No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses
     to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
     Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other
     intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor
     disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other
     entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or
     otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted
     hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure
     any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a
     third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute
     the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
     before distributing the Program.
  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
     copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright
     license set forth in this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under
its own license agreement, provided that:

  a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
  b) its license agreement:
      i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties
         and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or
         conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or
         conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
         damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
         consequential damages, such as lost profits;
    iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are
         offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
     iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
         Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
         manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

  a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
     Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
     within the Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution,
if
any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the
originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore,
if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and
other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial
Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial
product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims
or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property
infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:
a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and
b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the
Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at
its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If
that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers
warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are
such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a
court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the
Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using
and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the
risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to
or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of
operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION
LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the
parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent
necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself
(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted
under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue
and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to
time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this
Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The
Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement
Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will
be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the
Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the
Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program
(including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly
stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or
licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,
whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the
Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in
any resulting litigation.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

  a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
     Distributed under this Agreement, and

  b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
     i) changes to the Program, and
     ii) additions to the Program;

  and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
  "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
  such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
  Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
  are not Modified Works.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
or when combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.

"Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
or Modified Works thereof.

"Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.

"Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
documentation source, and configuration files.

"Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
Contributor.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
  grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
  license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
  publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
  Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.

  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
  grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
  license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
  import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
  if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
  apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
  the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
  of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
  Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
  combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
  licensed hereunder.

  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
  licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
  provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
  patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
  Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
  brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
  property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
  rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
  assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
  property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
  patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
  Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
  before distributing the Program.

  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
  sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
  the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

  e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
  Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
  those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
  receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
  (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).

3. REQUIREMENTS

3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:

  a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
  accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
  the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
  is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
  obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
  used for software exchange; and

  b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
  different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
     i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
     warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
     warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
     implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
     for a particular purpose;

     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
     liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
     incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;

     iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
     in the Source Code under section 3.2; and

     iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
     party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
     of this section 3.

3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:

  a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
  Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
  files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
  Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
  Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
  under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and

  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
  the Program.

3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
their own appropriate notices.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
participate in any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
Contributions) under the new version.

Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.

Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice

"This Source Code may also be made available under the following
Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth
in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."

  Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
  is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.

  If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
  file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
  file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
  look for such a notice.

  You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.
